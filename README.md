### Overview

> **our slogan**: Treat the map as a canvas, capturing the essence of a beautiful life

In the rapidly advancing digital age, the way people live and their habits of recording are undergoing transformation. Traditional map applications primarily focus on navigation and location search, often overlooking the needs for personal life recording and sharing. "Minstrel Map" aims to fill this market gap by providing a platform that combines maps with life recording, not only helping users plan their journeys and record every detail of their travels, but also capturing and sharing those special moments related to places in everyday life. This way of life recording combined with maps brings a new experience and memory storage method to users, adding emotional value to geographical information.
